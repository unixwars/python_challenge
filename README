I was introduced to Python by this game
(http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). If you haven't tried it, I totally
recommend it. It has since been updated and has a bunch of new levels.

Don't spoil the fun by peeping at the solutions first.

This code is very old and ugly, but it has sentimental value and
putting it out there will ensure it is never lost.  And who knows if
it can be of use to someone... just in case you get stuck.
